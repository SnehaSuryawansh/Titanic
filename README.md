# Titanic
-- This dataset contains information about various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and other relevant data points. 

# Project Synopsis
The objective of this project is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and other relevant data points.The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous yet unpredictable dataset used in data science to perform EDA tasks. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain insights into the key factors that influenced passenger survival and predicts survival outcomes.

# Key Findings
The analysis shows that females had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to males. Traveling in third class proved to be the deadliest, with the lowest survival rate among all classes. People in the age range of 20 to 40 were more likely to not survive the accident. Additionally, passengers who traveled with medium-sized families, consisting of one to three family members, had a better chance of surviving compared to those traveling alone or with large families.
